## Power Bi - Using Power BI to track the movies I watched
In this report, I have summarized the data on the last 50 films I have watched. I watched these movies between August 15, 2022, and May 21, 2023. The data was imported into Microsoft Power Bi, cleaned there, and then visualized.

Step 1: Import of data
The list of movies I have watched was obtained through a browser plugin from my account on the website www.filmweb.pl. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to retrieve the full list of nearly 900 movies using this method due to an error that kept popping up. However, I hope to soon try for the first time to obtain this data using Python.

Returning to the topic, as I mentioned earlier, the dataset contained the 50 most recent movies. While this may not be an impressive number, it will be even more interesting to draw some insights from what I have watched over the past year.

The imported table, saved in the .json format with the creatively named ‘Movies’, has 6 columns:

id,
title,
year,
rating,
date.
