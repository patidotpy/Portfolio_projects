### #1 Using Power BI to track the movies I have watched 
In this project, I have used data about the last 50 movies I have watched. These movies were watched by me between August 15, 2022, and May 21, 2023.
The data has been imported into Microsoft Power BI, cleaned, and then visualized.

#### Step 1: Import of data

The list of movies I have watched was obtained through a browser plugin from my account on the website www.filmweb.pl. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to retrieve the full list of nearly 900 movies using this method due to an error that kept popping up. However, I hope to soon try for the first time to obtain this data using Python.

Returning to the topic, as I mentioned earlier, the dataset contained the 50 most recent movies. While this may not be an impressive number, it will be even more interesting to draw some insights from what I have watched over the past year.

The imported table, saved in the .json format with the creatively named 'Movies', has 6 columns:
- id,
- title,
- year,
- rating,
- date.

`Count Titles = COUNT( Movies[ID] )`
